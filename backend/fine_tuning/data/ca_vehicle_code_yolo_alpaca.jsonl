{"instruction": "A vehicle detection shows a car running a red light. What law was violated?", "input": "YOLO detected: Vehicle at intersection, Traffic light: RED, Vehicle status: Moving through intersection", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 21453(a) - Red Light Violation. According to CVC 21453, a driver facing a steady circular red signal shall stop at a marked limit line, or before entering the crosswalk, or before entering the intersection, and shall remain stopped until an indication to proceed is shown. The detected behavior shows the vehicle failed to stop for the red signal."}
{"instruction": "YOLO detected two vehicles in an intersection. One turned left, one came straight. They collided. Who is at fault?", "input": "Vehicle 1: Turning left\nVehicle 2: Traveling straight\nLocation: Intersection\nResult: Collision", "output": "Based on California Vehicle Code 21801(b), Vehicle 1 (turning left) is likely at fault. CVC 21801 states that a driver intending to turn left shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching from the opposite direction which are within the intersection or so close as to constitute an immediate hazard. The left-turning vehicle failed to yield to the oncoming straight-traveling vehicle."}
{"instruction": "Video analysis shows a car didn't stop at a stop sign. What code applies?", "input": "Detection: Vehicle approached STOP sign, Vehicle did not come to complete stop, Vehicle proceeded through intersection", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 22450(a) - Stop Sign Requirements. CVC 22450 requires the driver of any vehicle approaching a stop sign at the entrance to, or within, an intersection to stop at a limit line, if marked, otherwise before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection. If there is no limit line or crosswalk, the driver shall stop at the entrance to the intersecting roadway. The detection shows the vehicle failed to make the required complete stop."}
{"instruction": "YOLO detected a vehicle traveling 85 mph in a 65 mph zone. What violation occurred?", "input": "Speed detected: 85 mph\nPosted limit: 65 mph\nRoad type: Highway\nConditions: Clear", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 22349(a) - Maximum Speed Limit. CVC 22349 sets the maximum speed limit at 65 mph on highways unless otherwise posted. Traveling 20 mph over the limit (85 in a 65) is excessive speed and may also implicate CVC 22350 - the Basic Speed Law, which prohibits driving at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent. This could result in enhanced penalties."}
{"instruction": "Person detection shows someone not wearing a seatbelt. What's the violation?", "input": "YOLO detection: Person in driver seat, Seatbelt: Not detected/visible, Vehicle: In motion", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 27315 - Safety Belt Requirements. CVC 27315 requires that both the driver and passengers of a motor vehicle wear properly adjusted and fastened safety belts. Failure to wear a seatbelt is a primary violation in California, meaning an officer can stop the vehicle solely for this offense."}
{"instruction": "Multiple vehicle detection shows a car following too closely behind another car at highway speed.", "input": "Vehicle 1: Lead vehicle, 65 mph\nVehicle 2: Following vehicle, 65 mph\nDistance between vehicles: 1 car length\nConditions: Highway, dry pavement", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 21703 - Following Distance. CVC 21703 prohibits the driver of a motor vehicle from following another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicle and the traffic upon, and the condition of, the roadway. At highway speeds (65 mph), a safe following distance should be at least 3-4 seconds, which translates to approximately 10-12 car lengths. One car length is dangerously close and constitutes tailgating."}
{"instruction": "Detection shows a vehicle changing lanes without signaling.", "input": "Vehicle position: Changed from left lane to right lane\nTurn signal: Not detected\nTraffic: Moderate\nTime: Daytime", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 22107 - Turn Signal Requirements. CVC 22107 requires that no person shall turn a vehicle from a direct course or move right or left upon a roadway until such movement can be made with reasonable safety and then only after giving an appropriate signal. The failure to signal a lane change is both a safety hazard and a citable traffic violation."}
{"instruction": "Child detection in vehicle shows no car seat, child appears under 8 years old.", "input": "YOLO detection: Child passenger, estimated age 6-7 years\nChild restraint system: Not detected\nVehicle: In motion on public road", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 27360 - Child Restraint System Requirements. CVC 27360 requires children under 8 years of age to be secured in an appropriate child passenger restraint system in the back seat. Children under 2 years must be in a rear-facing car seat. Failure to properly restrain a child is a serious safety violation and can result in fines and points on the driver's record."}
{"instruction": "Pedestrian detected crossing at crosswalk, vehicle approaching without slowing.", "input": "Pedestrian: In marked crosswalk, crossing\nVehicle: Approaching at 35 mph, not decelerating\nLocation: Intersection with traffic signal", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 21950(a) - Pedestrian Right-of-Way. CVC 21950 requires the driver of a vehicle to yield the right-of-way to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within any marked crosswalk or within any unmarked crosswalk at an intersection. The driver must slow down or stop if necessary to yield to the pedestrian. Failure to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk is both dangerous and illegal."}
{"instruction": "Bicycle detected, rider appears to be riding against traffic.", "input": "Bicycle detection: Single cyclist\nDirection: Against traffic flow (wrong way)\nLocation: Residential street", "output": "This is a violation of California Vehicle Code 21650 - Wrong-Way Riding. While CVC 21650 primarily addresses vehicle operation, CVC 21200 states that bicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as drivers of vehicles. This means bicycles must ride with traffic flow, not against it. Riding against traffic significantly increases the risk of collision as it reduces reaction time for both the cyclist and motorists."}
{"instruction": "Based on video analysis, determine fault in a rear-end collision.", "input": "Vehicle A: Stopped at red light\nVehicle B: Failed to stop, struck Vehicle A from behind\nSpeed: Vehicle B traveling 30 mph, did not brake\nConditions: Dry pavement, good visibility", "output": "Vehicle B is at fault. Under California Vehicle Code 21703, drivers must maintain a safe following distance and must not follow more closely than is reasonable and prudent. In rear-end collisions, there is a presumption that the following driver (Vehicle B) was following too closely or not paying attention. Vehicle B failed to observe the stopped traffic and failed to stop in time, violating the basic rules of safe following distance and due care."}
{"instruction": "Analyze intersection collision: Vehicle making illegal U-turn hit by oncoming traffic.", "input": "Vehicle 1: Made U-turn where prohibited (sign posted)\nVehicle 2: Traveling through intersection, had right of way\nResult: Collision in intersection", "output": "Vehicle 1 is at fault. According to California Vehicle Code 22100-22106, U-turns are prohibited in business districts and where signage prohibits them. Vehicle 1 violated CVC 22102 by making an illegal U-turn. Additionally, CVC 21801 requires drivers making turns to yield to approaching traffic. By making an illegal maneuver and failing to yield right-of-way, Vehicle 1 bears full responsibility for the collision."}
{"instruction": "What should a driver do if they witness a hit-and-run accident?", "input": "Scenario: Driver witnesses vehicle strike parked car and leave scene", "output": "Under California Vehicle Code 20002, leaving the scene of an accident is illegal, even if only property damage occurred. As a witness, you should: 1) Call 911 immediately to report the hit-and-run; 2) Try to note the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate; 3) Document the scene with photos if safe to do so; 4) Wait for police if possible to provide a witness statement; 5) Note the time, location, and damage. Your witness testimony can help identify the offending driver and ensure they are held accountable under CVC 20001-20002."}
